Toki Pona as a language is somewhat limiting, so we need a customized version
of it with some unique syntax extensions.

This modified version of Toki Pona ("The Simple Language") that is designed for
use in stories will be known as Toi Sona ("The Story|Knowledge Language").

The language features of Toki Sona that separate it from Toki Pona include...

- Words that are used as adjectives for nouns and adverbs for verbs must be
  hyphenated and attached to the noun/verb in question.
  Previous: tomo tawa
  New: tomo-tawa 
  Trans:   "car", lit. a [moving] [enclosed space]

- The "en" usage limit is escalated from tying 3 concepts together to having
  no such restriction.
  Previous: ona pi ma en ona en sina ------- li wile moku.
  New: ona pi ma en ona en sina en mi en ali li wile moku.
  Trans: The people of Earth and him/her and you and me and everyone wants to eat.

- 

- To enhance the noun modifier "pi" that is used to tie 2 noun concepts
  together, for example, suwi-telo pi kon-lete (lit. "sweet fluid of cold air",
  e.g. hot chocolate), we will now be able to "en" multiple pi's together like:
  [noun pi something en pi something]
  Previous: tomo-telo ni li jo supa-telo pi kiwen-jelo ----------------!
  New: tomo-telo ni li jo supa-telo pi kiwen-jelo en pi telo-tawa-nanpa!
  Trans: That bathroom has golden toilets with electronically sprayed water!

- Revamped noun descriptions: "pi" is used to mark a noun #2 to further
  detail a noun #1. I am adding "po" to mark a verb to describe the same noun
  #1. Any associated content is then suffixed with "la" to mark its ending, 
  followed by a continuation of the sentence with "li" (if needed).
  Previous: 
  New: 
  Trans: 

- To enable verb phrases to be used to describe a noun, I am adding the 
  I am adding the grammar particle "po". It 
  functions exactly like the way "pi" does, only the target of "pi" must be a
  noun while the target of "po" must be a verb.
  Example: ona po pali lon tenpo-suno li jo ali pona-suli.
  Trans: People that work during the day have a much better life.

- Toki Pona has no proper nouns, only proper adjectives. These are accomplished
  by invoking Custom words (manual words added to the core language) as
  descriptors for Core nouns. This becomes a problem, however, when the name of
  something itself spans multiple words, for example "Eiffel Tower".
  A construction of some kind is "tomo", so how might we do tomo-"Eiffel Tower"?
  I'd prefer not to use quotes in that manner as it becomes too complicated.
  For clarity purposes, I am doing concatenation with upper-case letters, so
  UpperCamelCase for the programmers reading this.
  Example: tomo-EiffelTower li suli-mute!
  Trans: The Eiffel Tower is huge!
