        The Wyrd Narrative Scripting Language
    </h1>
    <h3>
        By Will Nations
    </h3>
    <p>
    Wyrd is a narrative scripting language designed to allow users to compose
    information regarding narrative entities and sequences of events. The 
    targeted use cases for Wyrd are the following.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Describe properties of narrative entities in a narrative sense.
            <ul>
                <li>Characters</li>
                <li>Objects</li>
                <li>Places</li>
                <li>Lore/Ideas</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Deserialize Wyrd into data for different languages so that the
            information can be converted to text and back. 3rd party
            applications may then implement their own methods of drawing
            on their version of the deserialized Wyrd data. The language
            must also therefore be simple enough that it can easily be
            serialized back into Wyrd text from any given language's data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Generate events from Wyrd statements that rely on and edit the
            aforementioned data. 3rd party applications may then subscribe
            to those events to in turn react to Wyrd scripting.
        </li>
        <li>
            Wyrd must be capable of being used in ordinary dialogue speech,
            just as if it were a natural language. This is to ensure that
            one need not speak in a traditionally "programmatic" manner
            in order to communicate properly with a computer. This will in
            turn allow applications relaying on Wyrd to have AI personas
            that can react personally with their own clearly understanable 
            Wyrd speech.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div>
    To accomplish all of that, Wyrd shall need the following objects:
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Lexicon
            </p>

            <p>
                It must ultimately be able to...
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Pick out the individual words and punctuation in a 
                        stream of Wyrd text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Identify the syntactic relationship between words
                        and punctuation in a stream of Wyrd text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alert the Wyrd App when an unrecognized input is
                        detected, either due to unknown vocabulary or
                        confusing syntax discrepancies.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                The method by which the Lexicon shall operate is by 
                managing two distinct libraries of words, the "Core" and 
                the "Custom" words.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Core words are understood to be the basis upon which 
                    all other words are defined and understood. There must 
                    be few enough of these Core words that they can be 
                    learned quite easily by the average user. That is, they 
                    should not number anywhere beyond 150, if possible. 
                    This Core set will include both regular terms and those 
                    that serve only a functional purpose, grammatically 
                    speaking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Custom words are terms that have been specially 
                    introduced by users and communities. All custom words 
                    are to be used as adjectives of nouns or adverbs of 
                    verbs. That is, they will never stand alone, but 
                    instead will be syntactically recognized only by the 
                    things which they further describe.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Core words will be accessed in a read-only dictionary.
                    If a word is not marked as a Custom word, and if it
                    cannot be located in the Core dictionary, then an
                    exception will be thrown, alerting the Wyrd App that
                    an unrecognized input was encountered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Custom words will be accessed in a read-write dictionary.
                    If a word is marked as a Custom word, then the Custom
                    dictionary will be scanned for the Custom word. If found,
                    the dictionary will simply return all information
                    associated with the custom term. If not, then a new entry
                    will be made in the current Custom dictionary and all 
                    applicable information will be drawn from the incoming
                    Wyrd text stream and added to the dictionary's entry.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Ideally, each "version" of Wyrd would include the same set of
                Core words. Each individual client application that makes use
                of the Wyrd App would in turn include their own Custom
                dictionary for terms relevant to its own application.
            </p>

            <p>
                Given these specifications, the Lexicon can be used to
                accomplish the following tasks:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Verify that a given input stream contains only the
                    appropriate Core words and that all non-Core words are
                    properly marked as Custom, i.e. throw alerts for unmarked
                    non-Core terms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Generate a graph of the syntactic structure of the Wyrd
                    text.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                With this graph of information, the data can then be handed off
                to more specialized classes that are devoted to identifying
                the semantics involved in the syntactic structure and
                vocabulary contained within the Wyrd text presented.
            </p>
            <p>
                The question then to be posed is what exact format should this
                graph of information have when deserialized into data?
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A class that has, among other things, a map of the words
                    sorted by their role within the sentence. There is also
                    additional information associated with each, based on their
                    role. For example, nouns will have a list of all modifying
                    adjectives while adjectives will likewise have a list of
                    modifying adverbs as well as which noun they modify, etc.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
