# Wyrd-Narrative-Scripting
A scripting language that doubles as a natural language for simple and direct communication between users and computer programs.

With Wyrd, a given user should be able to program an application to...
- listen to, understand, and respond to simple speech.
- describe narrative qualities of narrative concepts (for example, the personality of a character) in narrative terms, yet in 
  a manner that the computer can easily convert to data.
- trigger events based on changes to narrative elements (if a character doesn't like what you have done, for example).
- issue commands to a World-Building application that can directly edit the world using your instructions.

Wyrd will encompass an AI and event system built on top of a customized artificial language called Toki Sona which itself will
be a derivation of an existing artifical language called Toki Pona. Toki Pona consists of 10 syntax rules and 120 words and supplies
a reasonable breadth and depth for discussing concepts using normal dialogue. Toki Sona will expand upon it for development with
stories and broaden the linguistic capabilities of the language by adding a few syntax rules and increasing the existing vocabulary.
I am writing the program in C++.
