# Wyrd-Narrative-Scripting
A scripting language that doubles as a natural language for simple and direct communication between users and computer programs.

With Wyrd, a given user should be able to program an application to...
- listen to, understand, and respond to simple speech.
- describe narrative qualities of narrative concepts (for example, the personality of a character) in narrative terms, yet in 
  a manner that the computer can easily convert to data.
- trigger events based on changes to narrative elements (if a character doesn't like what you have done, for example).
- issue commands to a World-Building application that can directly edit the world using your instructions.

Wyrd will encompass an AI and event system built on top of a custom scripting/constructed hybrid language called Tokawaje. That means that not only can you use it for describing, in narrative terms, scripted behaviors in an application (such as what python/C++/etc. might execute), but it also is designed to be a fully-spoken, constructed language (such as Lord of the Rings' Elvish). It is derived from an in-depth analysis of Toki Pona and Lojban, and is currently comprised of approximately 150 words.

For now, the parser is simply using RegEx, but a more detailed C++ parser is a current long-term plan.
